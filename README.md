# D2L Grade Calculator

This is a simple grade calculator extension for the D2L platform.

## Overview

I was tired of having to manually calculate my grades on D2L, so I made this extension to do it for me and display it at the bottom of the grades table.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
    - Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over **More Tools**, and selecting **Extensions**.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
4. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory.

## Usage

Once installed, navigate to your D2L grades page. The extension will automatically calculate your total grade and display it at the bottom of the grades table.

You can check the extensions status by clicking on the extension icon.
